##### Searching for the best editor for node.js + angular.js programming
Ok, i wanted to start a new web project with the **best** tools one can get. The future is node.js :D, so i could not resist to develop with it. As it's only for the backend i searched another framework for the frontend. There are really a lot of choices, so i decided to go with angular.js. I will try react later, this is also really powerful.
